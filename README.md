## How does it work? ðŸ¤”
the image is taken from a video of candies, then it's processed by using morphological methods and then creating bounding boxes in border of candies.
</br></br>
To check colors i use a range that was configured by testing on image earlier, then i check the dominant color and i check if it fits in range.
Then i set a bounding box with label of this candy and the color
</br></br>
To save positions and color of the candy i created a class, where i store all the information.
